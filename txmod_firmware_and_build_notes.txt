rfdesign txmod notes by buzz - Oct 4 2018

source code currently found here: https://github.com/RFDesign/mavesp8266/tree/txmod

cd mavesp8266
platformio run
platformio run -t upload --upload-port /dev/ttyUSB1
 platformio run -t uploadfs --upload-port /dev/ttyUSB1

( these commands will upload via a serial port, if the device is wired up as per the modified FTDI cable, and the programming jumper/s are set right )
They will also create a 'firmware.bin' and 'spiffs.bin' in the mavesp8266/.pioenvs/esp12e/ folder that can be web-uploaded in many cases.

If you have an existing firmware in the device, you can also upload via the web interface at http://192.168.4.1/ 
you need to upload :
firmware.bin  ( main firmware, minimal web pages, upload this first, then use it's web-interface to upload the spiffs.bin)
spiffs.bin   ( more detailed upload and success web pages and advanced mode page )
RFDSiK900x.bin ( standard 900x radio firmware )


LED indications: 
LED turns on/off slowly/sporadically a couple of times during a normal boot as it communicates with the 900x in AT mode etc. 
LED turns off while rebooting.
LED flashes a few times ( 4 or 5) quickly when a user/s laptop connects via WiFi, showing the wifi laptop-to-txmod connection is ok.
LED flashes rappidly for about 20 seconds while the 900x modem is in bootloader mode and being reflashed.
LED slow on/off at approx 2hz means its trying to put 900x into bootloader mode and failing to communicate with radio , check wiring to 900x, and retry/reboot.
during normal UDP operations, LEDs flickers/pulses as UDP data goes through it.  ( does not do this in TCP mode, LED stays on solid ).

Factory Reset:
Press&Release the button on the TXMOD 5 times within 5 seconds, and it will reboot and all the wifi settings will be factory-defaulted back to their original values.

be sure that your 'mkspiffs' command is newer than 0.2.0, prefer 0.2.3 :

my path: 
/home/buzz/.platformio/packages/tool-mkspiffs/mkspiffs
eg on linux: 
if yours is too old, you might be able to do a 'platformio update' and get a version newer than 1.2.00.0, but 
Updating tool-mkspiffs                   @ 1.200.0        [Up-to-date]
I had to get a newer mkspiffs from here:
wget https://github.com/igrr/mkspiffs/releases/download/0.2.3/mkspiffs-0.2.3-arduino-esp8266-linux64.tar.gz
tar -zxvpf mkspiffs-0.2.3-arduino-esp8266-linux64.tar.gz 
cp mkspiffs-0.2.3-arduino-esp8266-linux64/mkspiffs /home/buzz/.platformio/packages/tool-mkspiffs/mkspiffs

/home/buzz/.platformio/packages/tool-mkspiffs/mkspiffs --version
mkspiffs ver. 0.2.3
