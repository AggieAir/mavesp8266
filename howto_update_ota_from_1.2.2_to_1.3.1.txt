HOW TO FLASH 4M version OTA to a older version with 2M flashed on it...
------------------------------------------------------------------

apply 900x and ribbon cable.
wait for radio to be reflashed ( if it happens ) - 1min?

connect to 'ardupilot' wifi

upload the .4m.bin as firmware.bin to /update ( use the top button/s , press top-left, select file, then press top right )

after reboot, it will 'format spiffs' during the next boot, and might take time to come up - 2 mins? 

connect to 'TXMOD-XX-XX-XX' wifi.

refresh the /updatepage till it loads a webpage with 'step 1' and 'step2' in it..

At that page, you upload the  .4m.spiffs.bin  at 'step 2' in the page and reboot. 
progress bar goes across page, then 'file not found' displays, leave browser on that 'error' page.

wait while it reboots again and flashes the 900x modem again - 1min?

refresh 'error' page, and click title, or load http://192.168.4.1/   and look for version 1.3.1 and 'your flash size is 4M' 


if it gets stuck, press reset button 5 times, and it should reboot and continue.
